# somnium-net-core
Early .NET API implementation for my flutter app to retrieve artist details from an Azure SQL DB. 

As artist times and attendance can vary leading up to the day, it's important for the set times, stages, and other details to be dynamic. This should eventually allow administrators to update these details remotely from az cloud console, and have the app pull the details automatically.
