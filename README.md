# somnium-net-core
Early .NET API implementation for my flutter app to retrieve artist details from an Azure SQL DB. 

I've created an app (https://github.com/ryan-caarter/somnium) for Bay Dreams festival attendees to explore the festival lineup, check a map, schedule acts, buy tickets and listen to their music through Spotify/YouTube integration.

As artist times and attendance can vary leading up to the day, it's important for the set times, stages, and other details to be dynamic. This API should eventually allow event administrators to update these details remotely from azure, and have the app pull the details automatically on load.
