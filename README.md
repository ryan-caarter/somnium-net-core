# somnium-net-core
Early .NET API implementation for my flutter app to retrieve artist details from an Azure SQL DB. 

As artist times and attendance can vary leading up to the day, it's important for the set times, stages, and other details to be dynamic. This API should eventually allow event administrators to update these details remotely from azure, and have the app pull the details automatically on load.

Scheduling artist notifications will be handled locally on the user device in the case of celluar network tower congestion.
